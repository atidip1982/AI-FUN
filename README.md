Overview
The GPT Response Comparison Tool is a GUI application built using Tkinter and Sentence-Transformers. It allows users to compare two sets of GPT responses (one from ChatGPT and one from an in-house GPT model) and calculates the similarity between them using the SBERT model for semantic textual similarity.

Features
Text Input Fields: Users can input a question and the responses from both ChatGPT and an in-house GPT model.
Similarity Calculation: The tool computes the cosine similarity between the two responses and presents the result as a percentage.
Result Display: The results, including the question, responses, and relevancy score, are displayed in a table.
User-friendly Interface: A simple, easy-to-use GUI for seamless interaction.
Requirements
Python 3.x
Tkinter (for GUI)
Sentence-Transformers (for calculating similarity)
